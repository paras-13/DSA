## Graph Data Structure
Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.

# Directed and Undirected Graphs
1. Directed Graphs: The Directed graphs are such graphs in which edges are directed in a single direction.

2. Undirected Graphs: Undirected graphs are such graphs in which the edges are directionless or in other words bi-directional.
