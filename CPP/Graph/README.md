# Graph Data Structure
Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.

## Directed and Undirected Graphs
1. Directed Graphs: The Directed graphs are such graphs in which edges are directed in a single direction.

2. Undirected Graphs: Undirected graphs are such graphs in which the edges are directionless or in other words bi-directional.


## Representing Graphs
Following two are the most commonly used representations of a graph:<br>
[1. Adjacency Matrix Representation](https://github.com/paras-13/DSA/blob/main/CPP/Graph/adjacency_matrix.cpp)<br>
[2. Adjacency List Representation](https://github.com/paras-13/DSA/blob/main/CPP/Graph/adjacencyList.cpp)

## Graph Traversal
[1. BFS Traversal](https://github.com/paras-13/DSA/blob/main/CPP/Graph/BFSTraversal.cpp)<br>
[2. DFS Traversal](https://github.com/paras-13/DSA/blob/main/CPP/Graph/DFSTraversal.cpp)<br>
[3. BFS Disconnected Graph](https://github.com/paras-13/DSA/blob/main/CPP/Graph/BFSDisconnectedGraph.cpp)<br>
[4. DFS Disconnected Graph](https://github.com/paras-13/DSA/blob/main/CPP/Graph/DFSDisconnectedGraph.cpp)


## TopoLogical Sorting
[1. Topo Sort DFS](https://github.com/paras-13/DSA/blob/main/CPP/Graph/Topological_Sorting_Using_DFS.cpp)<br>
[2. Topo Sort BFS](https://github.com/paras-13/DSA/blob/main/CPP/Graph/Topological_Sorting_KahnsAlgorithm_BFS.cpp)
