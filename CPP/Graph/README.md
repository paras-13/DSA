# Graph Data Structure
Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges.

## Directed and Undirected Graphs
1. Directed Graphs: The Directed graphs are such graphs in which edges are directed in a single direction.

2. Undirected Graphs: Undirected graphs are such graphs in which the edges are directionless or in other words bi-directional.


## Representing Graphs
Following two are the most commonly used representations of a graph:
[1. Adjacency Matrix Representation](https://github.com/paras-13/DSA/blob/main/CPP/Graph/adjacency_matrix.cpp)
[2. Adjacency List Representation](https://github.com/paras-13/DSA/blob/main/CPP/Graph/adjacencyList.cpp)

## Graph Traversal
[1. BFS Traversal](https://github.com/paras-13/DSA/blob/main/CPP/Graph/BFSTraversal.cpp)
[2. DFS Traversal](https://github.com/paras-13/DSA/blob/main/CPP/Graph/DFSTraversal.cpp)
