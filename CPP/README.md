# DSA in C++

C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include an object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and compiled language. 

## Some of the features & key points to note about the programming language are as follows:

    Simple
    Machine Independent but Platform Dependent
    Mid-level language
    Rich library support
    Speed of execution
    Pointer and direct Memory-Access
    Object-Oriented
    Compiled Language
